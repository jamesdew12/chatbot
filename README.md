# chatbot
- I want to understand more about how ai works, so I decided to start by creating a very simple chatbot, that could help me under the Anatomy of a Chatbot.
- I started off by install nltk, then running python and importing nltk (nltk.download()).
Having never heard of NLTK, I was soon to learn what it is, Natural Langauge ToolKit.

- Learning about tokenization, Lemmatization, bag of words to vector process and stemming, were some of the key ideas I took from attempting this task. Furthermore the TF and IDF approach which help score the individual when turning them into a vector. Pre-processing data before it can be analysed is very important, an example is that all characters need to be the same case, so remembering to turn them all to one case (upper/lower).
